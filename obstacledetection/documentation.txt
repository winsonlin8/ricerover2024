For every meeting, put your documentation above the previous one. 
For things that are relatively complicated or are a long process 
(setting up raspberry pi, connecting to motor drivers), make a 
separate document and put the steps into there. The hallmark of 
good documentation is that someone who has no idea about anything

- FINALLY GOT ROS2 AND GAZEBO TO WORK ON UBUNTU DUALBOOT YAY
- Worked pretty well, although when following this tutorial (https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Advanced/Simulators/Gazebo/Gazebo.html) rViz2 (the software used to visualize data published on ROS2 topics), I would get an error about the topic queue being full, so nothing showed up on rviz :(
  - Message Filter dropping message: frame 'vehicle_blue/lidar_link/gpu_lidar' at time 91.500 for reason 'discarding message because the queue is full' 
  - idk how to fix yet, but will soon 
  - Gazebo used around 50 watts unplugged on my laptop, but I forced my Ubuntu to use my laptop's dGPU (rtx 4050) instead of the integrated graphics.
  - will do proper performance analysis with integrated to see how Gazebo will run on laptops w/o a dGPU

- Intel RealSense also worked nicely on Ubuntu dualboot
  - after installing from the realsense github (see https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/development/doc/distribution_linux.md#installing-the-packages), it ran well on my laptop
  - integrated cpu test
    - 38 to 40 watts plugged in, 2d stream, 720p 30 fps setting; ran at 50-60 fps
    - 40-50 watts unplugged, high cpu usage, 3d and 2d stream tested with default and high accuracy presets selected; ran at 30-40 fps
  - forced dGPU test
    - 35 to 40 watts plugged in with 3d, same camera settings as above; ran at 60-60 fps
    - 40 to 50% dGPU usage

- How I monitored power and resource consumption
  - Power usage (watts): I used ubuntu's built in `upower` command
    - `upower -e` shows list of devices, we're looking for 'battery_BAT0' to track watts, so we run below command
    - `upower -i /org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/battery_BAT0` but only show stats for 1 instant. to reload new current stats, I used a python script (see this: https://askubuntu.com/questions/878556/get-battery-status-to-update-more-often-or-on-ac-power-wake)
    - this is a terminal based UI unfortunately, the better, continuously updating GUI one didn't work (it was a GNOME extension called Power Tracker [https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/7341/power-tracker/])
      - only supports Ubuntu 24+, but we need to use Ubuntu 22.04 for ROS2 Humble
      - this would've done the perfect job, as it runs in the background
  - CPU/GPU usage (%): I used Mission Center (https://snapcraft.io/install/mission-center/ubuntu#install)
    - It's basically like Windows Task Manager, with the performance tab showing temps, percentage used, etc



11/19/24 (Israel)
- Worked on installing Ubuntu 22.04 on my laptop with dualboot
  - When allocating space for the Ubuntu installation on my drive via Windows Disk Management, I faced an issue that wouldn't allow me to allocate more than 341 MB (way too low for Ubuntu, as it requires 5 GB just to install it)
  - Apparently there was "immovable files" that were continously being updated as my computer was running, such as the hibernation sys file (used for Windows hibernation; hiberfil.sys in C:/ root) and the pagefile (used to improve Windows stability; pagefile.sys in C:/ root)
  - To resolve this, I was going to defragment my drive (which physically moves these "immovable files" out of the way to make space for the Ubuntu partition), but realized that defragging a solid state drive (basically what's on all modern laptops) is a bad idea; defrag should only be used on hard disk drives (the ones with spinning magnetic disks)
  - Instead, I disabled Windows' system restore point, system protection, hibernation, kernel memory dump, and USN journal (probably SHOULD NOT delete this, bc it's used for search indexing and Windows Defender indexing; see https://superuser.com/questions/819901/dangers-of-deleting-c-extend-usnjrnljdata)
  -  This allowed me to get 46000 MB (45 gigs) of space for Ubuntu, which is enough for me ig
  -  If this happens to you, see https://www.download3k.com/articles/How-to-shrink-a-disk-volume-beyond-the-point-where-any-unmovable-files-are-located-00432 for a tutorial on how to disable that stuff then reenable it after Ubuntu installation
- I also needed to disable Secure Boot and BitLocker drive encryption before installing Ubuntu. These can be done with a quick Google search.
- These are the dualboot tutorials I used: 
  - https://adamtheautomator.com/install-ubuntu-on-a-partition/
  - https://www.download3k.com/articles/How-to-shrink-a-disk-volume-beyond-the-point-where-any-unmovable-files-are-located-00432
- I've already made a bootable USB (SanDisk 128 GB usb stick in the box with the raspberry PI), so skip the Rufus steps
- Now I'm able to choose between Windows and Ubuntu via Ubuntu's GRUB bootloader on laptop boot.
- New USB cable for RealSense Camera fixed Eric's below issue


11/6/24 (Eric)
- Got the camera working on the windows computer with 15 fps pretty effectively
- The issue was we had to click "Enable Firmware Logging" in order for it to work better
- also diagnosed the issue as the usb cable can't transfer the data fast enough--it recognizes the camera as a usb2.1 connection, not 3.2 like it should be
- Put an order request for a usb 3.2 cable for the camera
- currently able to display a point cloud in the realsense viewer software

10/30/24 (Eric)
- tried setting up surface matching in python
- realsense cam needs libraries on mac
  - having issues downloading it
  - it requires python 3.7, which is deprecated for conda on macs, have to use pyenv instead
  - realsense sdk download having issues as well
    - https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/doc/installation_osx.md 
    - idk why it's not working

10/28/24 (Eric + Simar)
- Researched a method using OpenCV called Surface Matching
  - It creates a map of objects and obstacles of a 3d scene using a depth sensing camera
  - we need the camera to work before we can implement it, found out the usb cable is the issue
    - it kinda works on the lab computer

10/23/24 (Israel)
- Went through tutorials for Webots to prepare a custom Rover model.
- Also tried running the camera on a different laptop (high performance with an RTX 4050) but it still didn't work
  - I could only get the first frame to display, with the depth and RGB camera window showing the first frame
  - Could be an issue with the cable, since the RealSense software detects it as a USB 2.1 cable. EDIT: RealSense GitHub FAQ says a USB 3.0 connection is required for the camera to work properly.
  - definitely an issue with USB cable, since I got a bunch of "USB SCP Overflow" (too much info for the USB cable to handle) upon checking error logs
    - https://github.com/intelrealsense/librealsense/wiki/troubleshooting-q%26a#q-i-connected-the-camera-to-the-usb-port-but-it-is-not-recognized
  - I don't have a USB 3.2 cable to test with

10/23/24 (Eric + Simar)
- Tried running camera on raspberry pi, it crashed the whole pi
- not nearly enough specs to run the camera
- researching how to do obstacle detection on rough terrain
  - could try depth plane-fitting with the depth sensing camera
  - could try YOLO for image obstacle detection for the ice

10/23/24 (Winson)
- made moon
  - looks bad bc it's green and I think the rover will still fall through
  - will keep working on it
- made ice block
  - i think the ice blocks will only work locally, I will upload the ice jpg I used later

10/21/24 (Eric)
- Tried running ros2 on raspberry pi
- if running into issue with ros2 not working do this: 
  - echo "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
  - source ~/.bashrc
- camera not displaying on raspberry pi, may be due to high resolution (480 x 240) might be too much unfortunately
  - camera is recognized, but can't display

10/16/24 (Winson)
- started using Webots without ROS
- used existing moon simulation
- need to add obstacles
- sojouner keeps falling through the moon
  - next meeting, make our own moon

10/9/2024 (Eric)
- Attempted to fix openCV display issues
  - not firewall issue
  - not image sending issue
  - can't display window through ros2 for some reason, that seems to be the only issue
    - maybe it's an ubuntu vm issue or an ssh forwarding issue, but it just can't open the window

10/7/2024 (winson)
- tried to get gazebo and webots up
- documented both my efforts here: 
  - Gazebo: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VhbPSCJuqp6pfLCHEYAJm6LyN3EDYJzz1D0w2VvSqWE/edit 
  - Webots: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WJeDCwA8Hf5d19iUAJH6PS8BVx5zR-uCibAvhBIBd_E/edit

10/2/2024
- Webots:
- attempted to get ros controllers to communicate with Webots
- tried solving by changing firewall settings
- context: Cameron and Israel (me) are trying to use ROS2 on Webots
  - however the Windows version of Webots doesn't support ROS2, only the Linux version :(
  - so what we're trying to do is run the Webots program on Windows side (to make use of graphics drivers/hardware acceleration for rendering and physics)
  - while running ROS2 Webots stuff on WSL linux side.
  - however the Webots Windows client can't connect to the WSL Linux ROS2 robot nodes, most likely due to a Windows Firewall conflict.
  - Here's the tutorial we're following: https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Advanced/Simulators/Webots/Installation-Windows.html)
  - GitHub issue that's same as us: https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/issues/759
- still working/trying to solve issue as of 10/2/24.

- OpenCV + ROS2 integration using AutomaticAddison tutorial: (Eric Grun)
https://automaticaddison.com/getting-started-with-opencv-in-ros-2-foxy-fitzroy-python/
  - Webcam integration through Multipass: 
    - Need to stream webcam to multipass instance using ffmpg
    brew install ffmpg
    - Then can stream to the multipass instance with this: 
    ffmpeg -f avfoundation -framerate 30 -video_size 640x480 -i "0" -f mpegts udp://192.168.64.2:1234
    - (NOTE: replace 192.168.64.2 with the IP address of the multipass instance)
      - can find IP address in macOS terminal with: 
      multipass list
    - Once streaming the webcam, you need to replace the webcam id from 0 in the python code to udp://@:1234
    self.cap = cv2.VideoCapture('udp://@:1234')
    - Image publisher and subscriber works, but doesn't display the webcam footage yet as of 10/2/24
    - Keep in mind, need to run subscriber with the following line to keep it from crashing because of no window popup
    xvfb-run -a ros2 run cv_basics img_subscriber

9/30/2024
  - Mac: Editing ROS2 Code through VS Studio (Eric Grun)
    - install extension within vs-code: Remote - SSH
    - create ssh key with this line: set no password by clicking enter until it is created
      ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
    - copy paste ssh key from this line: 
      cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    - within multipass ros2 shell run this to edit the ssh keys file: 
      nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    - copy paste the ssh key within a new line of the nano file
    - run these lines within multipass after editing the authorized_keys file
      chmod 700 ~/.ssh
      chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    - now try to connect via ssh to the multipass shell with this in the mac terminal
      ssh ubuntu@192.168.64.2
    - if that works, connect via ssh in VS Code from the bottom left button and connect with the same line as above
