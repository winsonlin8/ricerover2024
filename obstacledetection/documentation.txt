/*
For every meeting, put your documentation above the previous one. 
For things that are relatively complicated or are a long process 
(setting up raspberry pi, connecting to motor drivers), make a 
separate document and put the steps into there. The hallmark of 
good documentation is that someone who has no idea about anything 
related to your project can learn about and replicate it.

- Webots:
- attempted to get ros controllers to communicate with Webots
- tried solving by changing firewall settings
- context: Cameron and Israel (me) are trying to use ROS2 on Webots
  - however the Windows version of Webots doesn't support ROS2, only the Linux version :(
  - so what we're trying to do is run the Webots program on Windows side (to make use of graphics drivers/hardware acceleration for rendering and physics)
  - while running ROS2 Webots stuff on WSL linux side.
  - however the Webots Windows client can't connect to the WSL Linux ROS2 robot nodes, most likely due to a Windows Firewall conflict.
  - Here's the tutorial we're following: https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Advanced/Simulators/Webots/Installation-Windows.html)
  - GitHub issue that's same as us: https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots_ros2/issues/759
- still working/trying to solve issue as of 10/2/24.

- OpenCV + ROS2 integration using AutomaticAddison tutorial: (Eric Grun)
https://automaticaddison.com/getting-started-with-opencv-in-ros-2-foxy-fitzroy-python/
  - Webcam integration through Multipass: 
    - Need to stream webcam to multipass instance using ffmpg
    brew install ffmpg
    - Then can stream to the multipass instance with this: 
    ffmpeg -f avfoundation -framerate 30 -video_size 640x480 -i "0" -f mpegts udp://192.168.64.2:1234
    - (NOTE: replace 192.168.64.2 with the IP address of the multipass instance)
      - can find IP address in macOS terminal with: 
      multipass list
    - Once streaming the webcam, you need to replace the webcam id from 0 in the python code to udp://@:1234
    self.cap = cv2.VideoCapture('udp://@:1234')
    - Image publisher and subscriber works, but doesn't display the webcam footage yet as of 10/2/24

  - Mac: Editing ROS2 Code through VS Studio (Eric Grun)
    - install extension within vs-code: Remote - SSH
    - create ssh key with this line: set no password by clicking enter until it is created
      ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
    - copy paste ssh key from this line: 
      cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    - within multipass ros2 shell run this to edit the ssh keys file: 
      nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    - copy paste the ssh key within a new line of the nano file
    - run these lines within multipass after editing the authorized_keys file
      chmod 700 ~/.ssh
      chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    - now try to connect via ssh to the multipass shell with this in the mac terminal
      ssh ubuntu@192.168.64.2
    - if that works, connect via ssh in VS Code from the bottom left button and connect with the same line as above
