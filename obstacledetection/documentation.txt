/*
For every meeting, put your documentation above the previous one. 
For things that are relatively complicated or are a long process 
(setting up raspberry pi, connecting to motor drivers), make a 
separate document and put the steps into there. The hallmark of 
good documentation is that someone who has no idea about anything 
related to your project can learn about and replicate it.

  - Mac: Editing ROS2 Code through VS Studio
    - install extension within vs-code: Remote - SSH
    - create ssh key with this line: set no password by clicking enter until it is created
      ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
    - copy paste ssh key from this line: 
      cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    - within multipass ros2 shell run this to edit the ssh keys file: 
      nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    - copy paste the ssh key within a new line of the nano file
    - run these lines within multipass after editing the authorized_keys file
      chmod 700 ~/.ssh
      chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    - now try to connect via ssh to the multipass shell with this in the mac terminal
      ssh ubuntu@192.168.64.2
    - if that works, connect via ssh in VS Code from the bottom left button and connect with the same line as above
