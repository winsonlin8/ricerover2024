/*
For every meeting, put your documentation above the previous one. 
For things that are relatively complicated or are a long process 
(setting up raspberry pi, connecting to motor drivers), make a 
separate document and put the steps into there. The hallmark of 
good documentation is that someone who has no idea about anything 
related to your project can learn about and replicate it.
